        Content: |-
          I'm Louis Thibault, a CogSci Ph.D. turned software developer, and this is my
          blog.  There's no official topic, but my thoughts tend to cluster around p2p
          networks and mathematics.
          
          I'm also the lead developer of [Wetware](https://github.com/wetware/ww), so I write about that too.
